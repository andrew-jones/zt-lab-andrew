== Introduction üîß

Generating patching reports is another essential automation task! Our Windows server is sure to need some patches, but we don't have direct access to the system. Let's use Ansible to gather the required patch information and provide this data back to our Windows team.

This approach allows us to assess patch requirements without disrupting production systems, providing valuable insights for maintenance planning and security compliance.

== Lab Exercise 01: Creating Windows Update Reports

=== Overview
We'll gather all the patch details and create a comprehensive report using Jinja templates. The report will even be published as a web page on our Windows host for easy access by the Windows team.

This automated approach provides several key benefits:
* **Non-Disruptive Assessment** - Scan systems without affecting operations
* **Comprehensive Reporting** - Detailed patch information with severity levels
* **Web-Based Access** - Easy sharing with stakeholders via browser
* **Automated Scheduling** - Regular assessments without manual intervention

=== Step 1: Access the Windows Update Template

.üìã Detailed Instructions
====
. Navigate to *Automation Execution* ‚Üí *Templates*
. Select *Windows Update Report*

Before we can launch the template, we need to create a survey to specify which update categories we want to search for.

NOTE: Surveys in Ansible Automation Platform allow templates to collect input from users at runtime, making automation more flexible and interactive.

=== Step 2: Create Survey Configuration

.üìã Detailed Instructions
====
. Navigate to the *Survey* tab
. Add the following survey configuration:

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Field | Value
| Question | Which update category are you wanting to search for?
| Description | Windows Update Category
| Answer variable name | update_catagory
| Answer type | Multiple Choice (single select)
|===

**Multiple Choice Options** (add each option individually using the + button):
* **Security Updates** - Critical security patches and fixes
* **Critical Updates** - Important system stability updates  
* **Tools** - Microsoft tools and utilities
* **Definition Updates** - Antivirus and security definitions
* **Updates** - General feature and performance updates

TIP: Start with Security Updates for your first scan as these are typically the highest priority for most organizations.

=== Step 3: Enable and Configure Survey

.üìã Detailed Instructions
====
. Click *Create survey question*
. Enable the Survey using the toggle at the top of the pane

IMPORTANT: Make sure to enable the survey toggle, or the template won't prompt for input during execution. The toggle should show as "ON" or highlighted.

The survey feature allows the same template to be used for different update categories without creating separate templates for each scenario.

=== Step 4: Execute the Template

.üìã Detailed Instructions
====
. Launch the template by clicking the rocket üöÄ icon
. From the dropdown list, select *Security Updates*
. Click *Next* and then *Launch*
. Wait for the template to complete execution

The scan process typically takes 2-3 minutes depending on the number of available updates and system performance.
====

=== Step 5: Review the Patch Report

.üìã Detailed Instructions
====
. Once the template completes, navigate to the *Windows Report* tab
. Review the outstanding updates needed for the system
. Note the generated timestamp and server information

The report is automatically published to the Windows server's IIS web service, making it accessible to team members via web browser.

== Verification: Scheduled Backup Jobs

=== Last Check: Verify Automated Backups

Before finishing, let's verify that our previously scheduled backup jobs are working correctly:

[%collapsible]
.üìã Detailed Instructions
====
. Navigate to *Automation Execution* ‚Üí *Jobs*
. Observe that your *Server Backup - VSS/Windows* jobs have run automatically
. Check the job status and completion times
. Run the *Check Windows Backups* template to verify VSS snapshots exist
. Review the snapshot creation timestamps and sizes

This verification ensures that both patching assessment and backup protection are working in harmony to maintain system security and data protection.
